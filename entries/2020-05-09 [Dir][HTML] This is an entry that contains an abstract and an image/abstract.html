This is a sample abstract: <i>
A vigilante is just a man lost in scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal and if they canâ€™t stop you then you become something else entirely. Legend, Mr Wayne.
